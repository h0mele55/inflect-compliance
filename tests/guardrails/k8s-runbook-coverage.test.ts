/**
 * GAP-12 step 10 — Structural ratchet for the Kubernetes deployment
 * runbook.
 *
 * The original GAP-12 acceptance criterion was "Ops team
 * self-sufficient" against a 4-axis runbook checklist:
 *   K8s deploy  ·  rollback  ·  scaling  ·  backup restore
 *
 * Steps 1-9 of GAP-12 land Helm/Terraform code; step 10 lives entirely
 * in `docs/deployment.md`. Without a structural ratchet, doc rot is the
 * obvious failure mode: a section gets renamed during a doc-cleanup PR,
 * or the K8s/EKS path drifts away from the per-env tfvars without an
 * accompanying runbook update, and ops loses the map.
 *
 * This test asserts the four runbook axes are visibly present in
 * docs/deployment.md and contain the load-bearing AWS-managed-store
 * commands that distinguish the K8s/EKS path from the legacy
 * docker-compose path. It does NOT validate prose quality — that's
 * the reviewer's job.
 *
 * Same shape as `tests/guardrails/encryption-key-enforcement.test.ts`
 * and the GAP-13 / GAP-17 ratchets.
