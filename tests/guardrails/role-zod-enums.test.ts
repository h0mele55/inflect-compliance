/**
 * Guardrail: every Zod enum that parses a `Role` must include OWNER
 * iff the route it gates is a member-management surface that might
 * legitimately accept an OWNER value (invite, role-update). Routes
 * that intentionally exclude OWNER (custom-role baseRole, SCIM) are
 * on a carved exemption list.
 *
 * Rationale: OWNER was added in Epic 1 PR 1. A Zod schema still
 * enumerating `['ADMIN', 'EDITOR', 'AUDITOR', 'READER']` on an
 * invite/role endpoint silently rejects OWNER with a 400 instead
 * of honouring a legitimate OWNER promotion — subtle bug the type
 * system cannot catch because Zod enums are runtime-only.
 *
 * Keep this in lockstep with the Prisma `Role` enum shape.
