/**
 * GAP-10 step 5 — API contract regression gate.
 *
 * Two complementary checks:
 *
 *   1. **Per-schema snapshot**. For every named OpenAPI component
 *      registered by the schema layer, snapshot its JSON-Schema
 *      fragment via Jest's `toMatchSnapshot()`. The snapshot file
 *      (`__snapshots__/api-schemas.test.ts.snap`) is committed,
 *      reviewable in PRs, and gives reviewers a per-schema diff
 *      when the contract changes. Adding/removing a property from
 *      a schema, changing an enum, tightening a min/max, etc. —
 *      all surface as a single named snapshot diff.
 *
 *   2. **Full-spec drift check**. Re-build the spec in-process via
 *      `buildOpenApiDoc()` and compare the serialised output
 *      byte-for-byte against the committed `public/openapi.json`.
 *      Catches the case where someone changed an annotation but
 *      forgot to run `npm run openapi:generate` — the committed
 *      file would lag the schema layer.
 *
 * What this catches in CI:
 *   - Removing a `.openapi(name, ...)` annotation (component
 *     vanishes from the snapshot list).
 *   - Renaming a component ID (snapshot keyed on the old name
 *     disappears, new entry has no committed snapshot).
 *   - Changing field types (e.g. string → number) — per-schema
 *     snapshot diff.
 *   - Adding/removing required fields — per-schema snapshot diff.
 *   - Tightening or loosening a constraint (min/max, enum
 *     values) — per-schema snapshot diff.
 *   - Forgetting to regenerate `public/openapi.json` after a
 *     schema change — full-spec drift check.
 *
 * On legitimate contract changes:
 *   1. Run `npm run openapi:generate` to update `public/openapi.json`.
 *   2. Run `npx jest tests/contracts/ -u` to update the per-schema
 *      snapshots.
 *   3. Commit both. The reviewer sees the diff against the
 *      previous contract and approves explicitly.
 *
 * Each step deliberately requires opt-in human action — there's no
 * "auto-update" path. A breaking API change can't slip through
 * without somebody making the call to update the snapshot.
