/**
 * R26-PR-F — Capstone meta-ratchet for the Processes roadmap.
 *
 * Asserts that every PR-A through PR-F deliverable still ships:
 *
 *   PR-A — domain model + APIs + persistence wiring
 *   PR-B — node taxonomy + richer palette
 *   PR-C — proximity auto-bind + snap
 *   PR-D — edge-first controls + semantic categories
 *   PR-E — editor UX (rename, duplicate, inspector)
 *   PR-F — polish (help strip, improved empty state, this ratchet)
 *
 * The meta-ratchet does NOT duplicate the structural assertions
 * each PR-specific ratchet already enforces. It locks the
 * EXISTENCE of every R26 file the roadmap depends on so a future
 * "tidy-up" PR that mass-deletes process/ files would fail CI
 * with a clear "you killed the roadmap" message.
 *
 * When a future R27 lands: this file stays as a historical
 * snapshot of "what R26 shipped". DO NOT update it for new
 * components — add a sibling capstone test instead. The list
 * here is meant to be frozen.
