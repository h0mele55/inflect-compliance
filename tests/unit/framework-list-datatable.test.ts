/**
 * Framework list + detail page ratchets.
 *
 * History on the LIST page:
 *
 *   - Epic 46.4 originally migrated the list to ListPageShell +
 *     DataTable. That migration was rolled back; the card grid
 *     read better at-a-glance for a small catalog and gave every
 *     framework a colour band.
 *   - This file briefly locked the OPPOSITE invariant ("never
 *     re-introduce DataTable on the list") as a revert ratchet.
 *   - Epic 66 deliberately re-introduced a TOGGLE: the new
 *     `<FrameworksClient>` island owns table/cards switching so
 *     the user can pick. Default stays cards, persisted via
 *     `useViewMode` under `inflect:view-mode:frameworks`.
 *
 * The revert ratchet was therefore retired with Epic 66 — the
 * "explicit re-decision" the ratchet asked for is exactly what
 * Epic 66 carried out. The list-page UX choice is now under the
 * Epic 66 ratchet at `tests/rendered/epic-66-rollout.test.tsx`,
 * not here. The detail-page builder-tab assertions stay — those
 * are independent of the list-page UX choice.
