# Epic 1 — Access Control & Tenant Onboarding (operator + contributor index)

> Closes GAP-01 from the enterprise-readiness audit: OAuth sign-in
> no longer silently grants ADMIN on the oldest tenant. Tenant
> membership is now explicit (token redemption) and lifecycle-aware
> (OWNER role + last-OWNER guard). Read the source links for details;

## Role model

```
OWNER   — tenant lifecycle + owner management (delete tenant, rotate
          DEK, transfer ownership, invite/remove OWNERs, assign OWNER
          role). Last ACTIVE OWNER of a tenant cannot be removed or
          demoted (DB trigger + usecase guard).

ADMIN   — operational control: invite/manage EDITOR/READER/AUDITOR,
          configure SSO/SCIM/billing/settings. Cannot touch OWNERs.
          Cannot assign OWNER role.

EDITOR  — create/edit all business entities.

AUDITOR — read-only everything + downloads + audit-pack share.
          For external auditors.

READER  — read-only business entities. Least privileged. Default for
          invites that omit a role.
```

**Permission keys added by Epic 1:**
- `admin.tenant_lifecycle` — delete tenant, rotate DEK, transfer ownership. OWNER-only.
- `admin.owner_management` — invite/remove OWNERs, assign OWNER role. OWNER-only.

Both explicitly `false` for ADMIN and below.

## Invitation flow

```
Admin clicks "Invite" in /admin/members
    → POST /api/t/:slug/admin/invites { email, role }
    → createInviteToken generates 256-bit base64url token
    → TenantInvite row: { email, role, token, expiresAt = +7d,
                           invitedById, acceptedAt:null, revokedAt:null }
    → Audit: MEMBER_INVITED

Invitee opens email, clicks /invite/<token>
    → preview page (tenant name, role, expiry) — NO consumption yet

Clicks "Sign in to accept"
    → GET /api/invites/<token>/start-signin
    → Sets inflect_invite_token cookie (HttpOnly, 10-min TTL)
    → 302 to /login

User completes OAuth
    → NextAuth signIn callback
    → ensureTenantMembershipFromInvite reads cookie
    → redeemInvite runs in two steps:
         Step 1 (standalone commit): atomic claim —
           UPDATE TenantInvite SET acceptedAt = now()
           WHERE token = X AND acceptedAt IS NULL AND revokedAt IS NULL
             AND expiresAt > now()
           Count 0? → fetch to produce 404/410 error.
           Count 1? → invite is now claimed.
         Step 2 (email binding check): if invite.email != session.email →
           throw forbidden. Invite IS BURNT (acceptedAt is committed,
           Step 1 did not get rolled back because it was a separate
           transaction).
         Step 3 ($transaction): upsert TenantMembership + read tenant
           slug. Audit MEMBER_INVITE_ACCEPTED.
    → User lands at /t/<slug>/dashboard with valid membership.

Uninvited OAuth user
    → signIn callback: no cookie, no invite redemption.
    → JWT minted with tenantId = null.
    → Middleware redirects all /t/** requests to /no-tenant.
```

## Last-OWNER protection

Two layers, both load-bearing:

1. **Usecase layer** (`tenant-admin.ts::updateTenantMemberRole` and
   `deactivateTenantMember`): counts ACTIVE OWNERs, throws
   `forbidden('Cannot demote/deactivate the last OWNER...')` with a
   friendly error message before the mutation lands.

2. **DB trigger** (`check_not_last_owner` function + BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE
   trigger on `TenantMembership`): raises
   `LAST_OWNER_GUARD: tenant % would have zero active OWNERs` with
   SQLSTATE P0001. Catches bypass attempts — raw `deleteMany`, code
   paths that skip the usecase, future bugs that forget the check.
   Defence-in-depth.

The two-step "transfer ownership" flow uses this to advantage:
promote the new OWNER FIRST (brings count to 2), then demote the old
OWNER (count drops to 1, but trigger is satisfied because count ≥ 1).

## Verification commands

### Invitation flow
```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npx jest \
    tests/integration/invite-redemption.test.ts \
    tests/integration/invite-routes.test.ts \
    --no-coverage
```
10 redemption cases + 5 HTTP-contract cases.

### Last-OWNER protection
```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npx jest \
    tests/integration/last-owner-guard.test.ts \
    tests/integration/last-owner-usecase-guard.test.ts \
    --no-coverage
```
DB-trigger tests + usecase-layer tests.

### Middleware tenant-access gate
```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npx jest \
    tests/integration/middleware-tenant-gate.test.ts \
    --no-coverage
```
Pure-function tests against `checkTenantAccess`.

### Vulnerability closure (PR 4)
```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npx jest \
    tests/integration/auth-signin-no-auto-join.test.ts \
    --no-coverage
```
Simulates the signIn callback — asserts no membership created without
a valid invite token.

### Guardrails (PR 5 — anti-regression)
```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npx jest \
    tests/guardrails/no-auto-join.test.ts \
    tests/guardrails/role-zod-enums.test.ts \
    --no-coverage
```

### Platform-admin tenant creation
```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npx jest \
    tests/integration/tenant-lifecycle.test.ts \
    tests/integration/platform-admin-tenant-creation.test.ts \
    --no-coverage
```

## Rollback procedures

### PR 4 rollback — restoring auto-ADMIN (DO NOT do this in prod)
Revert `src/auth.ts` signIn callback changes + remove the middleware
tenant-access gate. The vulnerability is reintroduced. The tree stays
type-safe but the guardrail `no-auto-join.test.ts` would STILL pass
(function name check only), so this regression is NOT automatically
caught — you'd need to also remove the assertion that
`ensureDefaultTenantMembership` is absent. Don't.

### PR 3 rollback — removing token-redemption
Revert `tenant-invites.ts` + the `/admin/members` POST change. The
old `inviteTenantMember` behaviour reappears. Invitations are silently
created as ACTIVE memberships for existing users — a milder version
of GAP-01. Don't.

### PR 2 rollback — dropping OWNER bootstrap
- Trigger: `DROP TRIGGER tenant_membership_last_owner_guard ON "TenantMembership"; DROP FUNCTION check_not_last_owner();`
- Bootstrap: `UPDATE "TenantMembership" SET role='ADMIN' WHERE role='OWNER' AND <audit marker matches>;`
  Audit log retains the `ROLE_PROMOTED_TO_OWNER` entries so the change
  is traceable.
- Platform-admin routes + `PLATFORM_ADMIN_API_KEY` env: remove both.
  Return 404 on the routes.

### PR 1 rollback — dropping OWNER enum value
Postgres does not support dropping an enum value without recreating
the type. Leave the enum value; no rows use it after PR 2's inverse
migration.

## Accepted residual risks (documented decisions)

The Epic 1 security validation enumerated 8 residual risks (R-1
through R-8). Five are closed by code (R-1 via JWT memberships array
+ tenant picker; R-3 email_verified check; R-4 platform-key rotation;
R-5 E2E spec; R-6 production Redis-required startup check). Three
are accepted with the following written rationale:

**R-2 — Invite cookie carries the token unencrypted.** The cookie is
`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production, with a 10-minute
TTL and single-use semantics. TLS protects in transit. Encrypting
the cookie value with a server-side secret would not change the
threat model — an on-path attacker who has broken TLS already has
much bigger problems. Accepted as-is. Tightening would add
complexity without security gain.

**R-7 — Bootstrap script must run once in production.**
`scripts/bootstrap-tenant-owners.ts` promotes the oldest ACTIVE
ADMIN per tenant to OWNER. It's idempotent (re-running is a no-op
on tenants that already have an OWNER) and emits an audit-chained
`ROLE_PROMOTED_TO_OWNER` entry per promotion. **Operator action:**
run `npm run db:bootstrap-owners` against prod once after deploying
PRs 1–2. Not a code closure — operational checklist item only.

**R-8 — CSRF-style invite acceptance is benign.** A malicious site
that links to `/api/invites/<attacker-token>/start-signin` could
trick an authenticated user into accepting an invite addressed to
their own email. Worst case: the user gets added to a tenant they
didn't request. They can leave via deactivate. The attack does NOT
escalate privileges, leak data, or compromise other tenants. Adding
a CSRF token tied to the preview page would close R-8 mechanically
but at the cost of breaking the preview-then-sign-in flow (the
token would be tied to the preview-page session, which the
post-OAuth session no longer has). Accepted as-is.

## Adding a new tenant-membership creation path (for future contributors)

The `tests/guardrails/no-auto-join.test.ts` guardrail enforces that
`tenantMembership.create` / `upsert` / `createMany` appears ONLY in
allowlisted files. If you're adding a legitimate new path:

1. Land the code with a clear audit trail (call `appendAuditEntry`
   or `logEvent` with a distinct action name like
   `TENANT_MEMBERSHIP_GRANTED_VIA_<mechanism>`).
2. Add the file to `ALLOWLISTED_MEMBERSHIP_SITES` in the guardrail
   with a one-line `reason` describing the security posture:
   - What authz gates this path? (Permission? API key? Token?)
   - What is the "source of truth" for the role assignment?
   - Is email binding enforced?
3. Run the guardrail to confirm.

## Adding a new legitimate OWNER-aware route

If your route's Zod schema parses a `Role` value and OWNER is a valid
input, add the file path to `MEMBER_MGMT_FILES` in
`tests/guardrails/role-zod-enums.test.ts`. If OWNER should be
intentionally rejected (e.g. custom-role baseRole, SCIM), add it to
`OWNER_EXEMPT_FILES` with a reason.
