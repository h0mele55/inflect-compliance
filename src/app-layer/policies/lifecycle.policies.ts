/**
 * Editable Lifecycle Authorization Policies
 *
 * Defines permission checks for lifecycle operations. These follow the
 * project's established authorization pattern:
 *
 *   - Accept `RequestContext` (and optional entity data)
 *   - Throw typed errors (`forbidden()`)
 *   - Called by domain usecases, never by routes
 *
 * Permission Matrix:
 * ──────────────────
 * | Action               | Required Permission | Typical Roles           |
 * |----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
 * | Edit draft           | canWrite           | ADMIN, EDITOR          |
 * | Publish / Deploy     | canAdmin           | ADMIN only             |
 * | View history         | canRead + canAudit | ADMIN, AUDITOR         |
 * | Archive              | canAdmin           | ADMIN only             |
 * | Revert to version    | canAdmin           | ADMIN only             |
 *
 * Design rationale:
 * ─────────────────
 * - **Draft editing requires canWrite** — EDITOR and ADMIN roles can create
 *   and modify draft content. This matches the existing policy: EDITOR can
 *   create versions, ADMIN can create versions.
 *
 * - **Publishing requires canAdmin** — Only admins can promote drafts to
 *   live/published state. This is a deliberate escalation from draft editing:
 *   publishing makes content authoritative across the organization.
 *   This matches the existing policy.ts pattern where publishPolicy() calls
 *   assertCanAdmin(ctx).
 *
 * - **History/version access requires canRead + canAudit** — Version history
 *   contains prior authoritative states. canAudit ensures only users with
 *   audit permissions can access historical snapshots, matching the
 *   audit trail access pattern used by `getControlActivity` and `getPolicyActivity`.
 *
 * - **Archive requires canAdmin** — Archiving is an irreversible operation
 *   that freezes the entity. Only admins can perform this action.
 *   This matches archivePolicy() → assertCanAdmin(ctx).
 *
 * - **Revert requires canAdmin** — Reverting loads a prior version into the
 *   draft. While it doesn't change the live state, it's a significant
 *   action that should be admin-controlled to prevent accidental content loss.
