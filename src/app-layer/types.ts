/**
 * Hub-and-spoke organization request context (Epic O-2).
 *
 * Resolved by `getOrgCtx({ orgSlug }, req)` for routes under
 * `/api/org/[orgSlug]/*`. Distinct from `RequestContext` (which is
 * tenant-scoped) — a single request resolves to ONE of the two,
 * never both. Drill-down from portfolio → tenant detail re-resolves
 * as `RequestContext` via the auto-provisioned AUDITOR membership,
 * where the existing per-tenant permission system takes over.
 *
 * `permissions` is derived from `orgRole` via `getOrgPermissions(...)`
 * at resolution time so callers can read flags directly without an
 * extra helper call. This mirrors how `RequestContext.permissions` /
 * `appPermissions` are pre-derived.
