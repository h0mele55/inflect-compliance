/**
 * Due-Item Ownership Resolution
 *
 * Centralized domain function for resolving the owner of a DueItem.
 * Every entity type that can generate a DueItem has an explicit rule here.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP RULES:
 *   - CONTROL   → ownerUserId
 *   - EVIDENCE  → ownerUserId (added 2026-04-17, was previously unlinked)
 *   - POLICY    → ownerUserId
 *   - VENDOR    → ownerUserId
 *   - TASK      → assigneeUserId (not ownerUserId — tasks use assignee)
 *   - RISK      → ownerUserId
 *   - TEST_PLAN → ownerUserId
 *
 * FALLBACK:
 *   When the resolved owner is null/undefined, the DueItem has no owner.
 *   The digest-dispatcher routes ownerless items to tenant admins.
 *   This is INTENTIONAL for legitimately unassigned entities.
 *   It is NOT intentional for entities that have an owner but fail to wire it.
 *
 * HOW TO ADD A NEW ENTITY TYPE:
 *   1. Add the entity to MonitoredEntityType in types.ts
 *   2. Add a rule to OWNERSHIP_RULES below
 *   3. Ensure the scanner selects the owner field
 *   4. Call resolveDueItemOwner() in the DueItem construction
 *   5. The regression test in due-item-ownership-guard.test.ts will
 *      catch missing rules
 *
