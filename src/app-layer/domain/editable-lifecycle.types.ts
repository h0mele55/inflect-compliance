/**
 * Editable Lifecycle Domain Types
 *
 * Typed contracts for a reusable draft/publish lifecycle pattern.
 * Any domain entity (policies, controls, risk treatments, assessments)
 * can adopt this lifecycle by defining its own TPayload shape.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * ─────────────
 *   DRAFT ──publish──▶ PUBLISHED ──archive──▶ ARCHIVED
 *     ▲                    │
 *     │              (snapshot to history)
 *     │                    │
 *     └──revert────── HISTORY[]
 *
 * The lifecycle is a pure state machine with no database coupling.
 * Persistence is handled by domain-specific repositories that map
 * EditableState to their Prisma models.
 *
 * Design Principles:
 * ──────────────────
 * 1. **Generic payload** — TPayload is domain-specific (Policy content,
 *    Control description, Risk treatment plan, etc.)
 * 2. **Explicit phases** — No ambiguous "status" enums; phase is one of
 *    DRAFT, PUBLISHED, or ARCHIVED.
 * 3. **Version = publish count** — Version only increments on publish,
 *    never on draft edits. This matches semantic versioning semantics.
 * 4. **Immutable history** — Published snapshots are append-only. Prior
 *    versions are never mutated.
 * 5. **Conservative transitions** — Cannot publish without a draft,
 *    cannot edit when archived.

// ─── Lifecycle Phases ────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The three lifecycle phases an editable entity can be in.
 *
 * DRAFT     — Entity has unpublished changes. May or may not have a
 *             published version. This is the initial phase.
 * PUBLISHED — Entity has been published. The live payload is the
 *             authoritative state. Draft is cleared on publish.
 * ARCHIVED  — Entity is frozen. No further edits or publishes allowed.
 *             History and published state are preserved for audit.
