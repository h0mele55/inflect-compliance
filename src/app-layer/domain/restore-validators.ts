/**
 * Audit Coherence S10 (2026-05-24) — entity-specific restore
 * validators.
 *
 * Pre-S10 `restoreEntity` only checked (a) the row exists in the
 * tenant and (b) the row is currently soft-deleted. Every other
 * precondition was left implicit. That left several routes for
 * the admin restore button to undo a soft-delete into an
 * inconsistent state:
 *
 *   - AuditPack restored under a CLOSED AuditCycle → the pack is
 *     now "open" again but its parent is frozen for audit, which
 *     contradicts the cycle-immutable contract.
 *   - AuditPack restored under a deleted AuditCycle → orphan.
 *   - Task restored whose controlId points at a deleted Control.
 *   - Evidence restored whose ownerUserId points at a removed
 *     membership.
 *
 * This module defines a per-model validator table the restore
 * usecase consults BEFORE clearing `deletedAt`. Validators are
 * pure (caller passes the snapshot row + a DB handle for parent
 * lookups); they throw `badRequest` with a specific message on
 * any precondition failure.
 *
 * Models without a custom validator fall through to
 * `NOOP_VALIDATOR`. Adding a new validator is intentional
 * narrowing — open one with a written precondition + a test row.
