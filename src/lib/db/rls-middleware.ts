/**
 * Epic A.1 — Prisma ↔ PostgreSQL RLS cooperation layer.
 *
 * This module is the canonical entry point for running Prisma queries
 * with PostgreSQL row-level-security in effect. It does three things:
 *
 *   1. Re-exports the transaction-scoped tenant-context helpers from
 *      `src/lib/db-context.ts` (`runInTenantContext`, `withTenantDb`,
 *      `runInGlobalContext`). These set `SET LOCAL ROLE app_user` and
 *      `set_config('app.tenant_id', …, true)` inside a Prisma
 *      `$transaction`, so every query inside the callback inherits
 *      the tenant context. `SET LOCAL` + `set_config(..., true)` are
 *      transaction-scoped — they auto-reset at commit/rollback and
 *      are safe under PgBouncer transaction pooling.
 *
 *   2. Provides `runWithoutRls` as the explicit, grep-able bypass
 *      path for admin / auth-discovery / webhook-ingest code. The
 *      superuser_bypass policy on every RLS-protected table permits
 *      non-`app_user` sessions, so calling the raw prisma client from
 *      inside this helper is sufficient. The helper exists for
 *      *documentation*: it makes the intent explicit at the call
 *      site instead of hiding in a bare `prisma.xxx.foo()` call.
 *
 *   3. Installs a Prisma `$use` tripwire (`installRlsTripwire`) that
 *      observes every query and logs when a tenant-scoped model is
 *      touched *without* either a tenant context or an explicit
 *      bypass marker. This is **defense in depth** — the authoritative
 *      isolation is in the database (RLS), the tripwire just makes
 *      dev-time detection louder than "empty result set".
 *
 * WHY NOT A PER-QUERY `SET LOCAL` MIDDLEWARE?
 *
 * The Epic A.1 brief suggested "before each query, SET LOCAL
 * app.current_tenant_id". A literal implementation would fail: Prisma
 * `$use` runs in the same async frame as the query it wraps, but a
 * bare `SET LOCAL` fired outside a transaction lands in its own
 * connection and doesn't affect the subsequent query. Inside a
 * transaction it works but is redundant with the transaction-level
 * set.
 *
 * The transaction-wrapper pattern is strictly superior:
 *   - One round-trip per transaction instead of N per query.
 *   - `SET LOCAL` naturally scopes to the transaction — commit/
 *     rollback resets automatically.
 *   - PgBouncer transaction-pool compatible.
 *
 * The brief's name (`app.current_tenant_id`) is also not what the
 * existing 51 policies use. We keep `app.tenant_id` for zero-churn
 * compatibility — the enforcement contract is the isolation model,
 * not the variable name.

 * any reason not in this set.

/**
 * Execute a callback with the raw `prisma` client — no tenant context,
 * no `app_user` role switch.
 *
 * RLS bypass is permitted because every tenant-protected table carries
 * a `superuser_bypass` policy of the form:
 *     USING (current_setting('role') != 'app_user')
 *
 * A session running as `postgres` (which is what Prisma's default
 * connection uses) matches this policy. Callers inside this helper see
 * all rows regardless of tenant.
 *
 * Use this SPARINGLY. Every invocation:
 *   - must supply a typed `reason` from `RlsBypassReason` (compile-time
 *     allowlist); arbitrary strings are rejected.
 *   - is logged at info level with the reason and a short caller
 *     fingerprint (module path from the stack trace), so audit
 *     review can find every bypass site without a grep.
 *
 * Anything not covered by an existing reason must go through
 * `runInTenantContext` so RLS enforces, OR get a new reason added
 * here after review.
 *
 * @example
 *   await runWithoutRls(
 *     { reason: 'auth-tenant-discovery' },
 *     async (db) => db.tenantMembership.findMany({ where: { userId } })
 *   );
