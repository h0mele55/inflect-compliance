/**
 * Epic 46 — Framework Viewer (TreeView foundation).
 *
 * Typed hierarchical contract for framework data. Shared by:
 *   - the API route (server-side serialization)
 *   - the framework tree builder (pure, deterministic)
 *   - the TreeView UI primitives (when wired into the framework page in
 *     a later prompt)
 *
 * The contract is INTENTIONALLY narrow at this layer — the generic
 * `TreeView<T>` component takes its own broader interface
 * (`TreeViewNode`) so it can be reused for non-framework hierarchies
 * (asset trees, org charts, taxonomy editors). `FrameworkTreeNode`
 * extends that contract with the framework-specific fields.

// ─── Node kinds ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The two structural roles a node can play in the framework tree.
 *
 *   - `section`  — synthesized grouping (theme, regulation article,
 *                  code-prefix bucket). Has no row in
 *                  `FrameworkRequirement`. Cannot be selected as a
 *                  requirement target — it only acts as a visual
 *                  container.
 *   - `requirement` — a real `FrameworkRequirement` row. The ones at
 *                  greater depth are CHILDREN of other requirements
 *                  whose `code` is a strict dotted prefix
 *                  (e.g. `5.1.2` is a child of `5.1`).

 * (`ControlRequirementLink` join + `Control.status` +

 * `computeNodeComplianceStatus`. The frontend never recomputes —
 * it just renders.
 *
 *   - `compliant` — every applicable mapped control is IMPLEMENTED.
 *   - `partial`   — some but not all applicable mapped controls are
 *                   IMPLEMENTED (work in progress).
 *   - `gap`       — there are no mapped controls, OR none of the
 *                   applicable ones are IMPLEMENTED.
 *   - `na`        — every mapped control is NOT_APPLICABLE
 *                   (deliberate scope-out, not a gap).
 *   - `unknown`   — the framework has been loaded without coverage
 *                   data (rare; render as neutral).
 *
 * Sections aggregate their descendants per the rules in
 * `aggregateComplianceStatus`.
